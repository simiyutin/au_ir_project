          <h3>Abstract</h3> 
          <p>The DARPA Virtual Robotics Challenge gave birth to the first version of CloudSim. It provided a centralized platform that facilitated teams of participants from around the world to compete in simulation simultaneously. Since then, various projects have demanded the need for a similar cloud hosted environment for robotics competitions. In this presentation, we reveal a new, redesigned CloudSim that aims to be a generic tool for running robotics software and simulations on the cloud. We present some of its key features including simulation instance sharing, reusable front-end web components, a WebGL visualization client, and security and authentication.</p>

          <h3>Abstract</h3> 
          <p>Late in 2015, Clearpath was facing a deployment crisis, with software in various states going to customer sites, off-site demos, in-house demos &amp; testing, and developer workstations. There was a build-up of cultural issues and technical limitations in the existing tooling. The solution to all of these issues has been to build the entirety of our robot's software in a single large workspace (using catkin<em>tools), and then ship the whole thing as one "fat" deb package. Lessons learned will be presented, along with a brief example of building a customized desktop</em>full bundle for Ubuntu - this should be sufficient to kickstart the efforts of anyone else who'd like to set up a similar build. The demonstration will highlight in particular our contributions to upstream ROS tooling which have been made in the course of this development work, hopefully merged in coming months</p>

          <p>The OSRF team has put a lot of work into the ROS buildfarm. It's used to provide continuous integration for the open source ROS community. Here he talks about how to both take advantage of the hosted version as well as leverage the components of the system for your own deployment if you wish. </p>

          <h3>Abstract</h3> 
          <p>The presentation is focused on the Python package ros_buildfarm. The various features provided are being described in detail which will improve the understand of the development process of ROS packages ranging from development and continuous integration over the release process to documentation. It will help you to leverage the provided infrastructure of build.ros.org for the development of your ROS packages and improve your workflow. Additionally it is being demonstrated how the software can be applied locally or e.g. via Travis to run your own "jobs".</p>

          <p><em>From Yoonseok Pyo</em></p> 
          <p>'ROS National Tour Seminar' in Korea was held on 21-25 August 2017 at Gwangju, Busan, Daegu, Daejeon, Seoul. More than 540 engineers and students were participated in this event that was organized by ROBOTIS CO., LTD. (directed by Dr. Pyo) and GIST, Dong-A University, Kyungpook National University, KAIST, Seoul National University.</p> 
          <p>This seminar was aimed at beginners of ROS, and we visited five major cities in Korea: Gwangju, Busan, Daegu, Daejeon and Seoul. Each day we spent 5 hours for the seminar, starting with the installation of ROS and learning about the introduction, features and tools. We then learned the concept of ROS based robot programming and tried various ROS development tools. Then we practiced SLAM, Navigation and Manipulation using ROS, TurtleBot3, OpenManipulator (to be announced at ROSCon2017) on the Gazebo simulator. Finally, in celebration of the 10th anniversary of ROS, we went over the ROS history and talked about future ROS development.</p> 
          <p>It was truly grateful experience that we were able to share a wonderful time talking about ROS with 540 people in a week.</p>

          <h3>Abstract</h3> 
          <p>At the ARGOS Challenge, we participate with our legged robot ANYmal in the autonomous inspection of oil &amp; gas sites. In this presentation, we share our experience with using ROS in our work and introduce our tools, many of which are available open-source. ANYmal is an electrically driven quadrupedal robot, capable of dynamic running, climbing over obstacles, and scaling stairs. It uses onboard laser range sensors to precisely localize and map its surrounding, enabling the autonomous navigation in difficult environments. For ARGOS, ANYmal carries several inspection sensors and uses computer vision to monitor the state of the site.</p>
